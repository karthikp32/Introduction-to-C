Dynamic Arrays 

Data structures that are like arrays except they can grow in size instead of keeping the initial size

As the dynamic arrays grows, the underlying memory used grows

We don't want to allocate too little memory or too much memory, we want to find the goldilocks zone
and find just the right memory required

Accessing a value takes O(1) time

1 memory address = 1 byte

C array backs Python lists, Javascript arrays, Ruby arrays in certain implementations like CPython
