Registers

-CPU does a computation in a fraction of a nanosecond or billions of computations per second
    -For ex. 0.25 computations per nanosecond

- Reading/writing to RAM from CPU takes about 50-100 nanoseconds which would really slow the computations down

- Reading/writing to registers from CPU takes about a fraction of a nanosecond which is much faster

- Certain CPU architecture like the x86-64 architecture can have 16 general purpose registers that 
can store 64 bits each 


- Compiler writes some values to registers

- Arithmetic Logic Unit can read two values like 1 and 2 from registers, add up the values,
and write the sum, 3, back to one of the registers
