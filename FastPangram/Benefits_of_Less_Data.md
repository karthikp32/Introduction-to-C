Benefits of Storing Data in Smaller Sizes

- Using less data means less space required
- A lot of times, less space means less time
- With smaller data, you might be able to store it in registers closer to the CPU

Thinking about runtime
- You can't just think about time complexity
- You also have to think about latency of the round trips that the CPU/computation has to make to storage
such as RAM, registers, etc. to fetch data as those affect the overall latency
